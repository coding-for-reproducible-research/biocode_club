# About Our Community

BioCode Club is a community for biologists and life scientists who want to develop their coding and data analysis skills. Our mission is to make computational biology approachable, collaborative, and practical by helping researchers confidently use tools like R, Python, and command-line workflows in their work.

We value openness, curiosity, and peer learning. Whether you’re just starting out or already working on bioinformatics projects, you’ll find a welcoming space to learn, share, and grow.
