This is an example of what a README file should include: a brief overview of the project, installation instructions, usage examples, details on dependencies, and any other relevant information to help others understand and reproduce your work.

```
1. Overview

2. Requirements

List of any software, packages, or tools needed to run the analysis, e.g., R version, specific R packages and versions, command line tools.

3. Installation

Instructions on how to set up the environment and install any necessary dependencies. If using renv, include steps for restoring the environment, for example:

# Install renv, if needed

Example:

01_import_data.R: Loads raw data into the workspace.

02_clean_data.R: Processes and cleans the raw data.

03_analyse_data.R: Performs the main data analysis.

04_plot_results.R: Creates visualisations based on the analysis.
6. Running the Analysis

Step-by-step instructions on how to execute the analysis, typically referencing the scripts in the correct order.

7. Outputs
